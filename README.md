# Platzi x New Relic x GitHub Edu June 2024 Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge, you'll gain an understanding of how observability helps software engineering teams to understand the health and performance of their systemsâ€”and see beyond not just what errors occur, but to know when and why. Also, we wanted to mimic a real worls scenario of building an application, assessing errors and fielding new challenges as they arise.

Through hands-on exercises, you'll explore observability and will learn how these practices enable engineers to gain insights into the inner workings of their applications, diagnose issues effectively, and make informed decisions to enhance performance and reliability.

You will also use Copilot to help you build, find and resolve problems in the coding infrastructure. Making you a more effective engineer.

## What level of experience is this challenge?
This challenge is good for all developers. It will be helpful if you are familiar with html, css, javascript, angular, and bootstrap. 

## Using New Relic for Debugging
We'll be viewing the telemetry data we receive from the Astro Shop application on New Relic, an all-in-one observability platform that allows us to view telemetry data from different services and infrastructure.


## Using Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant that helps you write code faster and with less effort, allowing you to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration. Copilot offers coding suggestions as you type: sometimes the completion of the current line, sometimes a whole new block of code. You can accept all, or part, of a suggestion, or you can ignore the suggestion and keep typing. For this challenge, we encourage you to use Copilot to help you find errors in the code so you can better understand how to resolve them.
